/**
 * Example demonstrating how to add DID with the role of Trust Anchor as Steward.
 *
 * Uses seed to obtain Steward's DID which already exists on the ledger.
 * Then it generates new DID/Verkey pair for Trust Anchor.
 * Using Steward's DID, NYM transaction request is built to add Trust Anchor's DID and Verkey
 * on the ledger with the role of Trust Anchor.
 * Once the NYM is successfully written on the ledger, it generates new DID/Verkey pair that represents
 * a client, which are used to create GET_NYM request to query the ledger and confirm Trust Anchor's Verkey.
 *
 * For the sake of simplicity, a single wallet is used. In the real world scenario, three different wallets
 * would be used and DIDs would be exchanged using some channel of communication
